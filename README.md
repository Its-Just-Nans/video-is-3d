# video-is-3d

- Inspiration from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZFxQXe7LMM>

The concept is to run a `modifier()` function on each pixel that returns new pixel coordinates with (x,y,frame_id). The new video can use the `frame_id` to traverse the video in this new third dimension.

Here are some examples:

## Notes

The current script is not fully optimized. It currently use multiprocessing to speed up the process with shared memory. But currently, the script is memory bound - it loads part of the video into the shared memory and other parts into the local memory of the process.
